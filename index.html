    <h1>Multi-Power Distribution MUX DC Motor Controller</h1>
    <p>A custom-built control system that operates multiple DC and AC motors using just one controller and a compact switching logic. This system intelligently distributes power based on sensor inputs, enabling full control over motion along X, Y, Z, and rotational axes — while using only two control lines.
Includes integrated PID voltage feedback, safety cutoffs, and PLC compatibility. Designed for scalable, sensor-based automation with minimal hardware overhead.</p>

    <h2> Frequency Based Microfluidic Low Viscosity Filter</h2>
    <p>An experimental filtration system that controls fluid flow using vibration frequency instead of pressure or mechanical valves. A piezoelectric pump sends wave pulses through a microchannel, and sensors detect whether the signal has stabilized at a desired frequency; only then is fluid allowed to pass.
This allows precise, non-mechanical filtering — ideal for lab-on-a-chip or biomedical applications requiring compact and reliable fluid handling.</p>
